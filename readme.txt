Free mini-extension for WooCommerce Gift Cards that allows you to use the default coupon form to apply and redeem gift cards.


== Description ==

Free add-on for the official [WooCommerce Gift Cards](https://woocommerce.com/products/gift-cards/) extension that allows you to use the default coupon form to apply and redeem gift cards.

After activating the plugin, the "Have a Gift Card?" form will be hidden, and customers will be able to apply gift card codes using the coupon input field.

**Note**: This plugin has been created to validate and refine a feature that may be rolled into WooCommerce Gift Cards — or dropped! — in the future.

**Important**: This plugin is not compatible with the Cart and Checkout Blocks.

**Important**: The code in this plugin is provided “as is”. Support via the WordPress.org forum is provided on a **voluntary** basis only. If you have an active subscription for WooCommerce Gift Cards, please be aware that WooCommerce Support may not be able to assist you with this experimental plugin.

== Installation ==

This plugin requires the official [WooCommerce Gift Cards](https://woocommerce.com/products/gift-cards/) extension. Before installing this plugin, please ensure that you are running the latest versions of both **WooCommerce** and **WooCommerce Gift Cards**.
